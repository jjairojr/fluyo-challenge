# Fluyo Challenge

I, Jairo, recently took on a translation game challenge as part of the technical assessment for Fluyo, and I must say it was a lot of fun! The average time I spent on the test, including both coding and project setup, was approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes. It was an enjoyable experience, and I'm excited to share the project with you.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

1. **Expo**: Expo is an open-source framework for building native applications for iOS, Android, and the web using JavaScript and React. It simplifies the development process by providing tools and libraries for various common tasks, such as managing assets, handling navigation, and accessing device features.

2. **Expo Status Bar**: The Expo Status Bar component allows you to customize and control the status bar (the bar at the top of the screen) in your Expo-based app. You can use it to set the background color, text color, and more.

3. **Firebase (Firestore)**: Firebase is a comprehensive cloud platform by Google that offers a wide range of services for building and scaling mobile and web applications. Firebase Firestore is a NoSQL cloud database that allows you to store and sync data for your applications. It provides real-time updates and synchronization across devices, making it ideal for building responsive and collaborative applications.

4. **React (18.2.0)**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently. React is at the core of many modern web and mobile app development.

5. **React Native**: React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using React. It allows you to write code in JavaScript and JSX and then deploy it as a native app on both iOS and Android platforms. This enables you to share code between different platforms.

6. **React Native Safe Area Context**: This library helps you handle safe areas on mobile devices, ensuring that content is properly displayed within the safe regions of the screen. It's crucial for creating a consistent user experience across different devices.

7. **React Query**: React Query is a library for managing and synchronizing data in your React applications. It provides tools for fetching, caching, and updating data, making it easier to work with remote APIs and maintain a responsive user interface.

8. **Styled Components**: Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS code as JavaScript literals. It offers a convenient way to style your React components by encapsulating styles within the component itself, promoting component-based design.

## Installation
